# Cola Factory Data Engineering

## Overview

This project focuses on processing data generated by cola factory machines, where these machines collect and send data to an AWS S3 bucket. The data primarily consists of reports indicating when a machine starts or stops working. Each start report is paired with a corresponding stop report. The data is transmitted in the form of CSV files, with each file potentially containing multiple reports collected over specific periods.

## Components

### 1. AWS Services

- **AWS S3:** The central storage for receiving and storing CSV files sent by the cola factory machines.

- **AWS Step Functions:** Orchestrates the end-to-end data processing workflow, defining the sequence of tasks for ingestion, transformation, and analysis.

- **AWS Lambda:** Serverless functions triggered by S3 events, responsible for copying, transforming, and initiating subsequent steps in the workflow.

- **Amazon Athena:** Allows SQL-based querying on the structured data stored in S3, providing interactive analysis capabilities.

- **AWS Glue:** Handles ETL tasks, automatically discovering, cataloging, and transforming data to make it available for analysis.

### 2. Python

- Python scripts are used within Lambda functions to implement custom data processing logic, enabling tailored operations on the data.

### 3. Terraform

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform for provisioning and managing AWS resources. The project is organized into modular and reusable Terraform modules for easy deployment and maintenance.

## How to Deploy~~~~~~~~

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mostafa-Alshaer/cola-factory-data-engineering.git
   cd cola-factory-data-engineering
   ```

2. **Configure Terraform:**
   - Edit the `terraform/terraform.tfvars` file to set the required variables such as AWS region, S3 bucket names, etc.

3. **Initialize Terraform:**
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   ```

4. **Deploy Infrastructure:**
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

5. **Monitor Execution:**
   - Observe the AWS Step Functions console for the progress of the data processing workflow.

6. **Access Results:**
   - Utilize Athena for querying and analyzing the processed data in the designated S3 output locations.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized to enhance modularity, maintainability, and extensibility. Key directories include:

- **lambda_functions:** Contains Python scripts for Lambda functions.
- **sql_queries:** Stores SQL queries used by Athena for data analysis.
- **terraform:** Houses Terraform modules for infrastructure provisioning.

## Security and Permissions

Ensure that AWS IAM roles and policies are appropriately configured for Lambda functions, Step Functions, Athena, and Glue jobs. Follow the principle of least privilege to enhance security.

## Future Enhancements

Certainly! Here's a shorter version for the "Future Enhancements" section:

## Future Enhancements

Explore opportunities for enhancing the Cola Factory Data Engineering project:

1. **Error Handling:**

3. **Cost Optimization:**
   - Optimize costs by considering strategies like leveraging spot instances for Glue jobs.

4. **Modular Extensions:**
   - Extend the pipeline to handle new report types or formats introduced by cola factory machines.

5. **Machine Learning Integration:**
   - Investigate integrating machine learning for predictive analytics or anomaly detection.

6. **Historical Data Archiving:**
   - Implement periodic archiving of historical data for efficient storage management.

7. **Custom Dashboards:**
   - Develop custom analytics dashboards for user-friendly data visualization.

8. **Cross-Region Replication:**
   - Enhance disaster recovery by implementing cross-region replication for critical data.

These enhancements aim to improve error handling, analytics, cost-effectiveness, and overall flexibility in response to evolving project needs.
